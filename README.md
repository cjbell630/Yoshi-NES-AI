This script is designed to be run on fceux. It might work on other emulators, but I haven't tested it.

# NOTE #
This is old code, and it was also my first time ever using Lua, so it's not great. I really want to update it soon, but first I (want) to finish documenting the FCEUX API file, since I switched from Atom to IntelliJ Pro, and I've been spoiled by IntelliJ. Also, whoever wrote the original FCEUX API made like half of the functions in all lowercase and without underscores, so IntelliJ registers them as typos. Which is REALLY irritating when every other line is underlined in yellow. So yeah, anyway, this will be improved someday. In the meantime, you can try it out. If you make something like this, let me know! I'd love to see it!
