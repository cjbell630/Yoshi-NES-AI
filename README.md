This script is designed to be run on fceux. It might work on other emulators, but I haven't tested it.
#LEGAL
* I own a copy of Yoshi for the NES.
* I do NOT distribute ROMs or emulators. You will have to find/rip those yourself. Do not ask me for either of them. 
* I hold absolutely NONE of the rights to any of the properties associated with Yoshi for the NES. Those belong to Nintendo and any other respective groups.
* This project is purely meant as an add-on to the original game. It is not intended to infringe upon any copyrights whatsoever. If you find that it has done so, please contact me and I will fix it.
